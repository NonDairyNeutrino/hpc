abstract="1 Qubits, gates and networks Consider the two binary strings, 011, (1.1) 111. (1.2) The first one can represent, for example, the number 3 (in binary) and the second one the number 7. In general three physical bits can be prepared in 23 = 8 different configurations that can represent, for example, the integers from 0 to 7. However, a register composed of three classical bits can store only one number at a given moment of time. Enter qubits and quantum registers:",
