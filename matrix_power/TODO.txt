TODO
- implement matrices with doubly-linked lists only for 2D arrays
-- maybe use https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Doubly-linked_list/Definition#Fortran
- use linked lists for large matrices
- calculate time complexity of power
- plot run time for different dimensions and powers
- write report
- report should be named FirstName_LastName_Lab1.pdf
- use different time functions: gettimeofday(), time(), clock(), etc.
- more error handling?
