- A supercomputer is more than JUST a large number of CPUs
- There are different architectures of the whole system that have substantial influence on the performance of the programs.
- Other factors that go into performance are:
	- Data Dependencies
	- Memory Sharing between processors
	- Redesign of algorithms
	- Message passing between processes
- Benchmarking takes into account not only the compilation of a program but also the hardware its run on and also the other tasks that were running at the same time, etc.
