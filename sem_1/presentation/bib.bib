title = {Gravitational lensing by spinning black holes in astrophysics, and in the movie Interstellar},
journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
abstract = {Interstellar is the first Hollywood movie to attempt depicting a black hole as it would actually be seen by somebody nearby. For this, our team at Double Negative Visual Effects, in collaboration with physicist Kip Thorne, developed a code called Double Negative Gravitational Renderer (DNGR) to solve the equations for ray-bundle (light-beam) propagation through the curved spacetime of a spinning (Kerr) black hole, and to render IMAX-quality, rapidly changing images. Our ray-bundle techniques were crucial for achieving IMAX-quality smoothness without flickering; and they differ from physicists’ image-generation techniques (which generally rely on individual light rays rather than ray bundles), and also differ from techniques previously used in the film industry’s CGI community. This paper has four purposes: (i) to describe DNGR for physicists and CGI practitioners, who may find interesting and useful some of our unconventional techniques. (ii) To present the equations we use, when the camera is in arbitrary motion at an arbitrary location near a Kerr black hole, for mapping light sources to camera images via elliptical ray bundles. (iii) To describe new insights, from DNGR, into gravitational lensing when the camera is near the spinning black hole, rather than far away as in almost all prior studies; we focus on the shapes, sizes and influence of caustics and critical curves, the creation and annihilation of stellar images, the pattern of multiple images, and the influence of almost-trapped light rays, and we find similar results to the more familiar case of a camera far from the hole. (iv) To describe how the images of the black hole Gargantua and its accretion disk, in the movie Interstellar, were generated with DNGR—including, especially, the influences of (a) colour changes due to doppler and gravitational frequency shifts, (b) intensity changes due to the frequency shifts, (c) simulated camera lens flare, and (d) decisions that the film makers made about these influences and about the Gargantua’s spin, with the goal of producing images understandable for a mass audience. There are no new astrophysical insights in this accretion-disk section of the paper, but disk novices may find it pedagogically interesting, and movie buffs may find its discussions of Interstellar interesting.}

The code supports non-trivial ‘many-boxes-in-many-boxes’ mesh hierarchies and massive parallelism through the message passing interface.  evolves the Einstein equation using the standard BSSN formalism, with an option to turn on CCZ4 constraint damping if required. The AMR capability permits the study of a range of new physics which has previously been computationally infeasible in a full 3 + 1 setting, while also significantly simplifying the process of setting up the mesh for these problems. We show that  can stably and accurately evolve standard spacetimes such as binary black hole mergers and scalar collapses into black holes, demonstrate the performance characteristics of our code, and discuss various physics problems which stand to benefit from the AMR technique.}

The purpose of this Note is to propose a time discretization of a partial differential evolution equation that allows for parallel implementations. The method, based on an Euler scheme, combines coarse resolutions and independent fine resolutions in time in the same spirit as standard spacial approximations. The resulting parallel implementation is done in the non standard time direction. Its main goal concerns real time problems, hence the proposed terminology of “parareal” algorithm.}

In this paper we reassess the accuracy of such simulations by running a convergence test on 20 Myr integrations of the Solar System using various symplectic integrators. We find that the specific choice of metric for determining a simulation’s accuracy is important. Only looking at metrics related to integrals of motions such as the energy error can overestimate the accuracy of a method. As one specific example, we show that symplectic correctors do not improve the accuracy of secular frequencies compared to the standard Wisdom–Holman method without symplectic correctors, despite the fact that the energy error is three orders of magnitudes smaller. We present a framework to trace the origin of this apparent paradox to one term in the shadow Hamiltonian. Specifically, we find a term that leads to negligible contributions to the energy error but introduces non-oscillatory errors that result in artificial periastron precession. This term is the dominant error when determining secular frequencies of the system. We show that higher order symplectic methods such as the Wisdom–Holman method with a modified kernel or the SABAC family of integrators perform significantly better in secularly evolving systems because they remove this specific term.}",

In addition a method is discussed that allows one to estimate the size of the effect as well as the uncertainty of the approach a priori. At the same time this enables the students to double check the results found numerically. The course is structured into a basic block and two further refinements which aim at more advanced students.}

abstract = {Mercury's close proximity to the Sun and relatively high eccentricity make it the only object in the solar system to exhibit significant general relativistic (GR) perihelion precession. Due to not having more observational data, we must resort to simulating how eccentricity changes the relativistic precession of an orbiting body's periapsis (the point in a body's orbit that is closest to the object in which it is orbiting). Since the Sun is only massive enough to display weak GR effects, and Mercury is far enough away, the gravitational interaction is modeled via perturbing (i.e. adding a small variation to) Newton's inverse-square law of gravity/modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). To fully describe the physics of the system, I investigate how the rate of precession due to General Relativity varies as a function of eccentricity. This data is analyzed to show how the rate of energy loss in the star-planet system due to the emission of gravitational radiation (gravitational waves/ripples in spacetime) varies with respect to the eccentricity of the planet's orbit. This information is then used to see how the eccentricity affects the time it takes for the planet to collide with the star. As a corollary, using it's parameters, Mercury's rate of precession is found to match the known value, thus confirming General Relativity is the current best explanation for Mercury's anomalous perihelion precession.}

A range of analysis tools have been run in situ to enable a diverse set of science projects and, at the same time, keep the resulting data amount manageable. Analysis outputs have been generated starting at redshift z ∼ 10 to allow for construction of synthetic galaxy catalogs using a semianalytic modeling approach in postprocessing. As part of our in situ analysis pipeline, we employ a new method for tracking halo substructures, introducing the concept of subhalo cores. The production of multiwavelength synthetic sky maps is facilitated by generating particle light cones in situ, also beginning at z ∼ 10. We provide an overview of the simulation setup and generated data products; a first set of analysis results is presented. A subset of the data is publicly available.}
